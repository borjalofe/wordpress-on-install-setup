# WordPress On-Install Setup

This script aims at easing the after-install process in which we usually do the same actions every time. As WordPress has its own on-install customization tools, we'll use them.

## Intro

You might think that each project is unique and needs its own customization -and somehow you'd be right- but you just need a minute to think and get to a simple conclusion: every time you start a new WordPress project, you do the same actions:

1. Install&Setup your preferred theme
2. Install&Setup your preferred plugins
3. Setup the WordPress site's options

But you can avoid doing this actions by yourself just using the same processes used by WordPress itself: the `wp_install_defaults()` function and `WP CLI`.

In this project, I'm trying to cover both methods so I -and you, by the way- can take advantage of them to automate and speed the first site setup.

## Technologies

WordPress-On-Install is created with:

- PHP
- Shellscript -WP CLI-

## How to use it

1. Get the WordPress files
   1. DO NOT INSTALL WORDPRESS!!!
2. Download the `install.php` file and upload it to the wp-content folder
3. Install WordPress -just do the 5-minutes install process
4. Done!
